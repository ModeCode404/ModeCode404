# 👋 About Me

I'm a developer in progress with a strong interest in **low-level systems**, **performance**, and **how things actually work under the hood**.

I daily drive **Kubuntu (Linux)** and deliberately stay close to the system — not because it’s trendy, but because abstractions only make sense once you understand what they hide.

- **Python**
  - Scripting, automation, problem solving
  - Using Python as a tool, not magic

- **C / C++**
  - Memory management
  - Pointers, data structures, performance
  - Understanding what higher-level languages abstract away

- **Low-Level Development**
  - How software interacts with hardware
  - Operating system basics
  - Binary-level thinking and debugging

## 🖥️ Environment

- **OS:** Kubuntu (Linux)
- **Editor:** VS Code / terminal-based tools
- **Mindset:** Learn by breaking things and fixing them

## 🎯 Goals

- Build a **solid foundation**, not shallow knowledge
- Become comfortable reading **documentation and source code**
- Move from *“it works”* to *“I know how it works”*

I'm not claiming expertise.
I'm building it.

This profile will grow as my skills do.
